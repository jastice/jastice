### Hello, I'm Justin Kaeser

I work on developer tooling at [JetBrains](https://github.com/JetBrains/). I am leading the development for Bazel support in IntelliJ IDEA, and I was a member of the [Scala plugin for IntelliJ IDEA](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-scala) team 2016-2022, focusing on build tool integration, specifically [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) and developing and evangelizing the [Build Server Protocol](https://build-server-protocol.github.io/).

## Projects I'm currently involved in

- [JetBrains Bazel Plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/hirschgarten) for IntelliJ IDEA, GoLand, and PyCharm. I'm the team lead, product manager, and responsible for customer success in Bazel integration for some of JetBrains' largest customers.
