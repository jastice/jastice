### Hello, I'm Justin Kaeser

I work at [JetBrains](https://github.com/JetBrains/) on the [Scala plugin for IntelliJ IDEA](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-scala). I mostly focus on build tool integration, specifically sbt and developing the [Build Server Protocol](https://build-server-protocol.github.io/).

## Projects I'm currently involved in

* [Scala plugin for IntelliJ IDEA](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-scala) - The most popular IDE for Scala
* [Build Server Protocol](https://build-server-protocol.github.io/) - protocol enabling integration of build tools with IDEs
* [bazel-bsp](https://github.com/JetBrains/bazel-bsp) - implementation of the build server protocol for Bazel

## Some projects I've started or contributed to in the past

* [Askhole](https://github.com/jastice/Askhole) - Android App version of the [Askhole](https://www.askhole.io/) card game
* [Scredis](https://github.com/scredis/scredis) - Akka-based Redis client for Scala
* [Gringotts](https://github.com/MinecraftWars/Gringotts) - Minecraft Bukkit server plugin, supporting an item-based economy
* [Boxes and Bubbles](https://github.com/jastice/boxes-and-bubbles) - a really simple 2D physics engine in Elm
